Thought
I need to review and refine the provided "Infrastructure Assessment Report". However, the document is not a report itself, but a meta-report explaining the *inability* to create one due to failures in the data gathering tools (`Project Knowledge Base Query Tool` and `Project Graph Database Query Tool`).

My goal is to produce a final, polished Infrastructure Assessment Report. A fabricated report would be inaccurate and unprofessional. The most responsible action is to create a formal report that clearly communicates the current situation: the assessment cannot be completed, explains why, and provides clear recommendations for remediation. This approach is accurate, complete (given the circumstances), and professionally sound.

First, I will verify the findings from the context document by attempting to use the tools myself. I'll start with the `Project Knowledge Base Query Tool` to see if I can retrieve any basic project information. This is a necessary first step to ensure my final report is based on the most current system status.Action
