## 1.0 Executive Summary

This report presents the findings and strategic recommendations from a comprehensive assessment of Innovatech Solutions' on-premises IT infrastructure. The primary objective of this assessment was to evaluate the current environment's capabilities and limitations and to formulate a detailed roadmap for migrating to a modern, scalable, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

**Key Findings:** Our analysis reveals that the current on-premises data center, while having served the company well, now poses significant risks to future growth and operational stability. The infrastructure is characterized by aging hardware (average 4.8 years), limited scalability to handle peak business demands, and high operational costs. Critical business applications, including the primary ERP and customer web portal, are built on monolithic architectures that impede agility. Furthermore, our security assessment identified several gaps, including inconsistent patch management and a lack of centralized security monitoring, exposing the organization to unnecessary risk.

**Core Recommendations:** We strongly recommend a phased, 12-month migration to the AWS cloud. This strategy is designed to minimize business disruption while maximizing long-term benefits. The approach leverages a mix of migration patterns (the "6 Rs"):
*   **Rehosting** legacy systems for speed.
*   **Refactoring** the core e-commerce application for scalability and performance.
*   **Replacing** the outdated internal CRM with a best-in-class SaaS solution.

**Projected Business Outcomes:** A successful migration to AWS is projected to deliver significant business value, including:
*   **Financial:** A **27% reduction in Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** over three years, with a projected ROI of 174% and a breakeven point at 18 months.
*   **Operational:** Achievement of a **99.99% availability** target for critical applications and a robust, automated disaster recovery posture.
*   **Strategic:** Enhanced business agility, enabling faster feature deployment and the ability to leverage cloud-native services for data analytics and AI/ML, driving future innovation.

This migration represents a strategic investment in the future of Innovatech Solutions, transforming IT from a cost center into a key enabler of business growth and competitive advantage.

## 2.0 Current State Analysis

### 2.1. Infrastructure Overview
The current IT infrastructure is hosted in a single on-premises data center at the corporate headquarters.
*   **Physical Plant:** Consists of 4 server racks operating at 85% power and cooling capacity, leaving minimal headroom for expansion.
*   **Server Inventory:** The environment comprises **58 physical and virtual servers**. A significant portion of this hardware is approaching or has exceeded its 5-year operational lifespan, increasing the risk of failure.
*   **Disaster Recovery (DR):** The current DR plan is inadequate, relying on manual tape backups with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of 48 hours and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 24 hours. This fails to meet the business continuity requirements for critical systems.

### 2.2. Server Inventory (Sample)
The following table provides a representative sample of the servers in the environment.

| Server ID | Hostname | OS | CPU (Cores) | RAM (GB) | Storage (TB) | Role | Age (Yrs) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SRV-001 | db-master-01 | CentOS 7 | 16 | 64 | 2.0 (SSD) | Primary DB (MySQL) | 5 | End-of-Life OS, high-risk |
| SRV-002 | web-prod-01 | Windows Svr 2012 R2 | 12 | 32 | 1.0 (HDD) | Web Server (IIS) | 6 | **Unsupported OS**, critical risk |
| SRV-003 | app-prod-01 | Windows Svr 2016 | 16 | 48 | 1.5 (HDD) | Application Logic | 4 | |
| SRV-004 | erp-db-01 | Windows Svr 2012 R2 | 24 | 128 | 4.0 (SSD) | ERP Database | 5 | **Unsupported OS**, critical risk |
| SRV-005 | ad-dc-01 | Windows Svr 2016 | 8 | 16 | 0.5 (HDD) | Domain Controller | 4 | |

### 2.3. Network Architecture
The network follows a traditional three-tier design (core, distribution, access) using Cisco equipment that is nearing its end-of-support date.
*   **Connectivity:** A single 1 Gbps internet circuit serves the entire organization, representing a critical single point of failure and a performance bottleneck.
*   **Security:** Firewall and routing rules are managed manually, leading to configuration drift and potential security gaps. There is no segmentation between development and production environments.

### 2.4. Application Portfolio
*   **E-commerce Portal:** A monolithic Java application with a tightly coupled MySQL database. This architecture makes updates slow, risky, and difficult to scale during traffic spikes.
*   **ERP System:** A legacy client-server application dependent on an outdated version of Windows Server and MS SQL Server.
*   **Internal CRM:** A bespoke, poorly documented application built on deprecated libraries, making it a high-risk, high-maintenance system.

### 2.5. Security and Compliance Posture
*   **Vulnerability Management:** A recent scan confirmed multiple critical vulnerabilities tied to unsupported operating systems (Windows Server 2012 R2) and outdated application libraries. The patch management process is inconsistent and manual.
*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Access control is decentralized and managed on a per-server basis, lacking a centralized IAM solution. This creates an auditability and security challenge.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** There is no centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. Logs are stored locally on servers, making proactive threat detection and incident response nearly impossible.

## 3.0 Recommended Migration Strategy

We recommend a strategic, phased migration to AWS using the "6 Rs" framework to align the technical approach with business value for each workload.

### 3.1. Migration Approach (The 6 Rs)

| Strategy | Description | Target Workloads | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Rehost** | "Lift and Shift" workloads to AWS EC2 instances with minimal changes. | Domain Controllers, File Servers, Internal Wiki | Fastest migration path for foundational services. Minimizes complexity and establishes an initial cloud footprint. |
| **Refactor** | Re-architect applications to leverage cloud-native features. | E-commerce Portal | Decompose the monolith into microservices on Amazon EKS. Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora for superior scalability, performance, and resilience. |
| **Revise** | Modify or upgrade workloads before migrating. | ERP System | Rehost the application tier on EC2 for compatibility, but migrate the database to Amazon RDS for SQL Server to offload management and improve performance. |
| **Rebuild** | Re-engineer an application from scratch using cloud-native services. | Internal Reporting Tools | Decommission inefficient legacy tools and rebuild a modern, serverless analytics platform using AWS Lambda, S3, and QuickSight. |
| **Replace** | Decommission an existing application and replace it with a SaaS product. | Internal CRM | Retire the high-risk, low-value internal CRM and migrate data to a market-leading SaaS solution (e.g., Salesforce) to improve functionality and reduce overhead. |
| **Retire** | Decommission workloads that are no longer needed. | ~10 identified servers | Eliminate obsolete applications and underutilized servers to achieve immediate cost savings on licensing, maintenance, and migration effort. |

### 3.2. Phased Migration Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Key Activities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Foundation & Pilot** | Months 1-3 | • Establish Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE).<br>• Design and deploy AWS Landing Zone (VPCs, IAM, Security).<br>• Provision secure network connectivity (AWS Direct Connect).<br>• Migrate a low-risk pilot application (e.g., internal wiki) to validate processes. |
| **Phase 2: Core Services** | Months 4-7 | • Rehost Active Directory and file servers to AWS.<br>• Begin data migration and user onboarding for the new SaaS CRM.<br>• Implement centralized monitoring and logging with Amazon CloudWatch. |
| **Phase 3: Critical Applications** | Months 8-12 | • Execute the refactoring of the E-commerce Portal using a blue-green deployment strategy.<br>• Execute the revision of the ERP system during a planned maintenance window.<br>• Finalize decommissioning of on-premises hardware and data center exit. |
