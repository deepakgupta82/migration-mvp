From security_analysis.txt: Security Analysis Report:

CURRENT SECURITY POSTURE:
- IAM: Role-based access control implemented
- Encryption: Data at rest encrypted with AWS KMS
- Network: Security groups configured with least privilege
- SSL/TLS: Valid certificates, TLS 1.3 enforced
- Monitoring: CloudTrail enabled for audit logging

IDENTIFIED VULNERABILITIES:
1. CRITICAL: Some EC2 instances missing latest security patches
2. HIGH: Database password policy not enforcing complexity requirements
3.

From security_analysis.txt: HIGH: No Web Application Firewall (WAF) configured
4. MEDIUM: MFA not enforced for all administrative accounts
5. MEDIUM: Log retention period set to only 30 days
6. LOW: Some unused security groups still active

COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- SOC 2 Type II certification required
- PCI DSS Level 1 compliance for payment processing
- GDPR compliance for EU customer data
- HIPAA compliance for healthcare data processing

SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Implement AWS WAF with OWASP Top 10 rules
2.

From security_analysis.txt: Enable AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
3. Configure AWS Config for compliance monitoring
4. Implement AWS Secrets Manager for credential management
5. Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
6. Set up AWS Security Hub for centralized security findings.
