### **Technical Architecture Document: Nagarro AgentiMigrate Platform**

**Version:** 1.2
**Audience:** Enterprise & Solutions Architects
**Date:** July 21, 2025
**Author:** Gemini, Enterprise AI Architect
**Status:** Final

#### **1. Introduction & Vision**

Nagarro AgentiMigrate is an intelligent, multi-cloud modernization platform engineered to de-risk and accelerate the enterprise cloud transformation lifecycle. The platform's core thesis is that modern migration complexity has surpassed the efficacy of manual playbooks and simple scripting. We address this by employing a framework of collaborative, specialized AI agents that execute the entire migration journeyâ€”from deep-state discovery and dependency mapping to automated, zero-downtime execution and continuous FinOps/SecOps optimization.

This document details the technical architecture of the platform, designed to be a resilient, scalable, and secure system that productizes Nagarro's deep expertise in cloud and AI.

#### **2. Architectural Principles & Tenets**

The platform's design is governed by the following architectural tenets, which serve as the decision-making framework for its construction:

*   **Zero-Trust, Client-Perimeter Deployment:** The entire platform is architected to run within the client's own cloud environment (VPC/VNet). This is a foundational security principle that eliminates the need for data exfiltration and complex data residency concerns. Communication between all components is encrypted via mTLS.
*   **Domain-Driven, Composable Design:** The system is decomposed into bounded contexts (e.g., Project Management, Assessment, Execution) realized as independent microservices. This allows for clear ownership, independent scalability, and the ability for clients to subscribe to a subset of platform capabilities.
*   **Event-Driven & Asynchronous Communication:** To ensure resilience and scalability, inter-service communication primarily relies on an asynchronous, event-driven pattern using a message bus. This decouples services, allows for graceful degradation, and supports long-running agentic workflows without blocking synchronous API calls.
*   **Polyglot Persistence:** We reject a "one-size-fits-all" database strategy. The platform utilizes a mix of relational (PostgreSQL), graph (Neo4j), and vector (Weaviate/Chroma) databases, each chosen for its suitability to model a specific type of data (state, relationships, and semantic meaning, respectively).
*   **Glass Box AI & Full Auditability:** While the agents operate with a high degree of autonomy, their decision-making process is not a black box. Every agent action, tool invocation, and generated artifact is logged to a centralized, immutable store, providing a complete audit trail for governance and diagnostics.
*   **Cloud-Agnostic Orchestration, Native Execution:** The core platform and agentic logic are portable. However, the `Executor` agents are designed to be cloud-native, directly interfacing with the best-of-breed services from each provider (e.g., AWS MGN, Azure Site Recovery, GCP Migrate for Compute Engine) to ensure maximum fidelity and performance during the actual migration.

---
#### **3. MVP Architecture & Technology Stack**

To validate the core hypotheses of the platform, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was constructed. The MVP focuses on proving the feasibility of the agentic RAG pipeline and demonstrating immediate value through the Discovery, Strategy, Design, and Planning modules, now with added project management capabilities.

*   **MVP Objective:** To provide a local, web-based application where a user can create and manage assessment projects, upload client documents for a specific project, and witness a crew of AI agents collaborate in real-time to produce a Cloud Readiness Report.
*   **Deployment Model:** A self-contained set of containers deployed locally using Docker Compose, managed by PowerShell scripts (`setup.ps1`, `run-mpv.ps1`).
*   **Architecture:** A microservices-based architecture was used to separate concerns and improve scalability.
    *   **`project-service`:** A dedicated FastAPI microservice responsible for all project-related CRUD operations, acting as the single source of truth for project state.
    *   **`backend`:** The main FastAPI application containing the core agentic logic (CrewAI orchestration) and business workflows for assessment. It communicates with the `project-service` to manage project context.
    *   **`frontend`:** A React application providing the user interface for project management, file uploads, and viewing assessment results.
    *   **Data Layer:** A polyglot persistence model:
        *   **`PostgreSQL`:** A relational database serving the `project-service` for storing structured project data (names, clients, status).
        *   **`Weaviate`:** The vector store for semantic search capabilities within the RAG pipeline.
        *   **`Neo4j`:** The graph database for storing and querying relationships between discovered IT assets.
    *   **RAG Pipeline:** Leveraged **`MegaParse`** for robust document parsing.
*   **MVP Technology Stack:**
    *   **Orchestration:** Docker Compose
    *   **Backend Services:** Python 3.11, FastAPI
    *   **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Mantine
    *   **Agent Framework:** CrewAI
    *   **Document Parsing:** MegaParse
    *   **Databases:** PostgreSQL (Relational), Weaviate (Vector), Neo4j (Graph)
    *   **Build/Deploy:** Docker, PowerShell

The MVP successfully proved that the core agentic workflow is viable and delivers compelling results, justifying the investment in the full production architecture outlined below.

#### **4. Production System Architecture & Data Flow**

The production system evolves the MVP's concepts into a scalable, domain-driven architecture.

![High-Level Architecture Diagram](httpss://i.imgur.com/your-architecture-diagram.png) *(Self-correction: Placeholder for a visual diagram illustrating the following flow.)*

**Typical Data Flow (Assessment Workflow):**
1.  **UI -> API Gateway:** A user initiates an assessment. The request is authenticated and routed.
2.  **API Gateway -> Project Service:** The request hits the `project-service`, which validates state in **PostgreSQL**.
3.  **Project Service -> Message Bus:** Publishes `AssessmentInitiated` event onto **NATS**.
4.  **Assessment Service (Listener) -> Message Bus:** Consumes the event.
5.  **Assessment Service -> Agentic Core (CrewAI):** Initializes the "Discovery & Strategy Crew".
6.  **Agents -> Tools -> Data Layer:** Agents execute tasks, populating and querying **Weaviate (Vector)** and **Neo4j (Graph)** via the **MegaParse** service.
7.  **Agentic Core -> Assessment Service:** The final agent returns its deliverable.
8.  **Assessment Service -> Message Bus:** Publishes `AssessmentCompleted` event.
9.  **Project Service & WebSocket Service:** Consume the event to update state in **PostgreSQL** and push results to the UI.

#### **5. Agentic Framework: Discovery & Planning Crews**

This section details the two foundational crews responsible for the initial assessment phases, corresponding to **Modules 1 & 2**.

##### **5.1. Crew 1: Discovery & Strategy**
*   **Objective:** Transform raw client data into a structured, queryable, multi-modal knowledge base and produce a factual brief.
*   **Agents:**
    1.  **Engagement Analyst:** In the MVP, this agent is responsible for both data ingestion and analysis. It populates the data layer, interfacing with `MegaParse` to populate `Weaviate` with semantic vectors and `Neo4j` with a graph of entities and relationships. It then performs **Cross-Modal Synthesis** by querying the **Neo4j graph** to understand explicit structure and uses that information to formulate targeted semantic queries against the **Weaviate vector store** to uncover implicit business context.
*   **Deliverable:** A detailed internal JSON object representing the complete, synthesized knowledge of the client's current state.

##### **5.2. Crew 2: Design & Planning**
*   **Objective:** To take the synthesized brief from Crew 1 and produce a client-ready, actionable migration plan.
*   **Agents:**
    1.  **Principal Cloud Architect:** Designs the target architecture using tools with knowledge of cloud service catalogs, pricing APIs, and IaC templates.
    2.  **Risk & Compliance Officer:** An adversarial agent that audits the proposed architecture against discovered compliance requirements (GDPR, DORA, etc.), forcing iteration until the design is compliant.
    3.  **Lead Planning Manager:** A project management agent that performs **Wave Planning** using the dependency graph from Neo4j to group applications into logical migration waves, minimizing business disruption. It synthesizes all approved artifacts into the final report.
*   **Deliverable:** The "Cloud Readiness & Migration Plan" document.

#### **7. Future Roadmap & Advanced Agent Crews**

The AgentiMigrate platform is designed to be modular and extensible. The following sections outline the planned evolution of the platform beyond the initial discovery and planning capabilities.

##### **7.1. Phase 3: Migration Execution (Module 3)**
*   **Objective:** To take the wave plan from the previous phase and execute the technical migration with maximum automation and minimal downtime.
*   **Integration Strategy:** This phase introduces `Executor` agents that are thin wrappers around the cloud providers' native migration tools. The core platform sends a standardized task (e.g., "Replicate VM-123"), and the provider-specific agent translates this into the appropriate API calls for that cloud.
    *   **AWS:** The `AWS Executor` will interface with the **AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)** API to install replication agents, monitor sync status, and orchestrate test/cutover launches.
    *   **Azure:** The `Azure Executor` will interface with the **Azure Migrate and Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** APIs to manage replication and failovers.
    *   **GCP:** The `GCP Executor` will use the **Migrate for Compute Engine** API to manage migration waves and runbooks.
*   **Agent Crew: Migration Execution**
    1.  **Lead Migration Engineer:** A "master" agent for this phase. It consumes the Wave Plan and sequences the execution tasks for a given wave.
    2.  **IaC Automation Specialist:** A code-generation agent that takes the Terraform stubs from the planning phase and fleshes them out to build the target landing zone and application infrastructure.
    3.  **Cloud Operator (Executor Agent):** A family of agents (`AWS Executor`, `Azure Executor`, `GCP Executor`). It receives a specific task (e.g., "replicate-vm") and the necessary credentials, and is responsible for making the actual cloud provider API calls.
    4.  **Real-time Healer Agent:** An observability agent that monitors the health of the replication process. If it detects a broken link or a failed sync, it can trigger automated remediation actions (e.g., restarting a replication service) or escalate to a human operator.
    5.  **QA Validation Agent:** After a cutover, this agent runs pre-defined smoke tests and performance benchmarks against the new cloud instance to validate the success of the migration.

##### **7.2. Phase 4: Modernization & Optimization (Modules 4 & 5)**
*   **Objective:** To move beyond "lift-and-shift" and provide AI-powered tools for application modernization and continuous cost/security optimization, aligning with Nagarro's "Fluidic Enterprise" vision.
*   **Agent Crew: Application Modernization**
    1.  **Code-Decomposition Analyst:** An advanced agent that uses static code analysis and LLM reasoning to scan monolithic codebases (e.g., Java, .NET). It identifies logical seams and proposes microservice decomposition strategies.
    2.  **API Generation Specialist:** Takes the proposed decomposition and generates OpenAPI specifications for the new microservice APIs.
    3.  **Microservice Scaffolder:** A code-generation agent that creates boilerplate code for the new microservices in the target language, including Dockerfiles and basic CI/CD pipeline configurations.
*   **Agent Crew: Continuous Optimization (FinOps/SecOps)**
    1.  **FinOps Analyst Agent:** Continuously monitors cloud spend using tools like AWS Cost Explorer or Azure Cost Management. It identifies cost-saving opportunities like right-sizing instances, purchasing Savings Plans/Reserved Instances, and identifying orphaned resources.
    2.  **SecOps Sentinel Agent:** Continuously scans the cloud environment using native tools (e.g., AWS Security Hub, Azure Defender for Cloud). It detects security posture drift, new vulnerabilities, and compliance violations, automatically creating tickets or triggering remediation scripts.

This roadmap provides a clear path for evolving the AgentiMigrate MVP into a comprehensive, market-leading cloud transformation engine.
